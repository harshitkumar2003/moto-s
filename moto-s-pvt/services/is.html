            damage caused to the bike due to an accident, theft, or collision. The bike insurance plays a pivotal role
            in safeguarding financial and legal obligations, which might arise in case of any unfortunate accident,
            natural disaster such as fire, landslide or man-made causes such as theft, riots, vandalism and so on.
            <span></span>
            Bike insurance policies cover all sorts of two-wheelers, such as motorcycles, scooters, moped bikes and
            electric bikes as well. As per the Indian Motor Tariff, 2002, it is mandatory for every bike owner to have
            at least a third-party bike insurance policy.

        <h1>Why Is Bike Insurance Necessary?</h1>
        <p>It can prove to be extremely fatal and risky, if you own a bike and you do not have an insurance policy for
            it. By just paying a nominal amount for an insurance policy, one can claim quite a reasonable amount of
            money in the hour of need. Below are the reasons which states clearly that why it is necessary for any
            vehicle owner to have a bike insurance policy:</p>
        <span></span>
        Safeguards you from Legal Fines: In India, it is illegal to drive any bike without having a valid third-party
        bike insurance policy. Therefore, it is mandatory to have a proper bike insurance in place which saves you from
        paying hefty legal fines.
        <span></span>
        Coverage for Natural and Man-Made Disasters: Insurance policies cover damage to the bike caused by natural
        calamities such as landslides, floods, earthquake, fire and so on. With proper insurance in place, one can
        easily make a claim under these unforeseen situations.

        the bike can be worse. But if your bike is insured, then you don’t have to worry much, as immediately when you
        report the theft of your bike, the insurance company is bound to cover the cost of replacing your vehicle.
        <span></span>
        Coverage Against Third-Party Liabilities: A third-party bike insurance which is mandatory, provides financial
        protection to your bike against any damages or injuries caused to a third party, with an involvement of your
        vehicle in an accident.
        <span></span>
        Coverage Against Own Damages: One of the most important reasons to have a bike insurance policy, is that it aids
        financial help to the insured bike owner for any cost incurred on repair work of damaged bikes due to accidents
        or any man-made or natural calamities.

        <h1>Key Features And Benefits Of Bike Insurance</h1>

            your vehicle and third-party person or property, in case of the occurrence of any accident or mishap. Having
            a bike insurance also covers you against loss and damage arising due to theft, strike or war. While

            soon as they insure themselves under a bike insurance policy. This cover provides coverage to the bike rider
            against any bodily injuries or death arising due to an accident. It is crucial to have a personal accident
            cover especially when you drive, but if you do not have a separate PA cover, you can definitely get it along
            at the time of buying a bike insurance for you.

        <h1>Different Types Of Bike Insurance Policies?</h1>
        While buying a bike insurance, you can select from the various kinds of insurance policies based on your
        coverage requirement. The bike insurance in India is broadly categorized into three major kinds, which are:

        <h1>Third-Party Insurance</h1>
        In India, as per The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, it is mandatory to own a third-party insurance to ride a bike on
        Indian roads. Third-party insurance covers all injuries, disabilities or death caused to the third-party due to
        an accident from the insured’s bike. However, the insured’s bike damages or theft is not covered under this
        plan. The third-party premiums have been already decided by the insurance regulator of India, IRDAI, which are
        as follows for FY 2022-2023.

        <p>Engine Cubic Capacity of Bike Third Party Insurance Premium (INR)
            Less than 75 cc 538
            75 – 150 cc 714
            150 – 350 cc 1,366
            Exceeding 350 cc 2,804
            Comprehensive Insurance
            This kind of insurance policy provides an all-rounder protection to the bike owner. It covers you, your bike
            and also third-party person or property from any financial damages caused. It also includes a personal
            accident cover for the owner-driver. One must go for comprehensive insurance to ensure full safety for your
            bike.
            <span></span>
            However, due to extensive coverage, this kind of insurance is more expensive than the third-party bike
            insurance policy. At the same time, in comprehensive insurance, the insured has the full liberty of adding
            optional riders such as zero depreciation cover, engine protection, key replacement and so on at an extra
            premium cost.
        </p>

        <h1>Standalone Own-Damage (OD)</h1>
        <p> This kind of bike insurance covers damages caused to your own vehicle, in the unfortunate event of accident or mishap. In this plan, the insured receives the financial protection for their own insured bike. This policy does not cover any damages caused to third-party persons or property.</p>
